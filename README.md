# CodeVision

**CodeVision** is a rural-first, device-inclusive coding framework built for South African learners with limited internet access.  
We blend **offline logic games** and **hands-on activities** with **online coding tools** to make programming accessible for all.

## 🌍 Why CodeVision?

Millions of rural learners are locked out of the digital future.  
CodeVision breaks the cycle by teaching coding logic *before* needing devices or internet.

## 🔌 Our Solution: The Unplugged Code Framework™

| Concept     | Offline Activity           | Coding Logic       |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| Algorithms  | Movement & Recipe Cards    | Sequencing         |
| Loops       | Origami & Musical Rhythms  | Repetition         |
| Conditions  | Logic Games                | If / Else          |
| Variables   | Color-coded Tokens         | State Management   |
| Functions   | Story Mapping, Song Lyrics | Abstraction        |
| Debugging   | Puzzle Challenges          | Problem Solving    |

After mastering logic offline, students “cross over” to digital tools like Scratch and JavaScript using shared laptops.
