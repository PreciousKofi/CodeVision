# CodeVision
Code Vision empowers rural South Africa through coding education. Using the Unplugged Code Frameworkâ„¢, we teach programming concepts with offline activities and transition to online coding with tools like Scratch. Our mission is to build digital literacy, scale across Africa, and prepare learners for the future.
